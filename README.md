# Egyptian-ID-Card-Address-Extraction-with-OCR
This project uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to accurately extract address information from Egyptian national ID cards. The core of the solution is a powerful **Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN)** model combined with the **Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function** to handle variable-length text sequences.
